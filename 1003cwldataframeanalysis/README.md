## Errata

All problems:  when counting deaths, please use the `matchevents_df` table that we prepared
in HW Week 9.  Do NOT use the "kills" field from `playermatches_df`.

Problem 3 contains a typo.  Should read "where each pair contains the 
*map* name and total number of deaths that occurred in that map for the entire tournament."
